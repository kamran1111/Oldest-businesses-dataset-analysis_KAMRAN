I am enrolled in Data Science using Python track on DataCamp.
So far, (on 23 Sep 2023), I have completed 5 courses:
1. Python Introduction
2. Intermediate Python
3. Data Manipulation with pandas
4. Joining Data with pandas
5. Introduction to Statistics in Python

Based on my learning, I have practiced this project. 

In this project, I have analyzed dataset of oldest businesses in the world. The "datasets" folder contains the data used in the project.

**"Statement of Academic Integrity"** The code written in this project is my own with chunks of already written code provided by DataCamp. I have completed it after completing the above courses. I have not copied code from anywhere, except few hints provided by DataCamp.

Thank you.
